My fitness app is the perfect application for anyone trying to track their workouts, stay motivated and keep their new years resolutions.

This application allows the user to track workouts on a daily. The user can submit a workout each day or multiple worksouts in one day. The options consist of cardio or resistance workouts. Once a workout is completed the next workout can be started(typically the next day). This application also has a dashboard which shows results and graphs or workout minutes and weight lifted.
